## 2026-05-16 - Initial BPO SaaS MVP

### Changes
- Created a standalone Next.js + TypeScript app at `apps/bpo-platform`.
- Added MVP authentication with seeded admin/member users.
- Added dashboard, report creation, report builder, admin, and PDF download routes.
- Added structured report section schemas for the first migrated BPO/PCR/MAR/CMA/report assembly workflow.
- Added local JSON-backed persistence for users, organizations, memberships, properties, report projects, submissions, and generated PDFs.
- Added server-side merged PDF generation using `pdf-lib`.
- Initialized Git locally, created the first commit, and connected/pushed the repo to `https://github.com/marcellis23/BPOSaaS.git`.

### Reasons
- The product direction was set as a Forms MVP first: support Ronald's own valuation/report production workflow, then open the same workflow to paying member agents.
- A standalone app was chosen so authenticated report creation, saved projects, and later subscriptions can live outside WordPress while existing public content remains available as marketing/education material.
- Local persistence was used for the MVP to keep the first version simple and testable before choosing a production database.

### Verification
- Ran `npm run lint`.
- Ran `npm run typecheck`.
- Ran `npm run build`.
- Smoke tested the app in browser: signed in, created a report, saved a Cover Page section, exported a merged PDF, and confirmed the project showed `Exported`.
- Confirmed Git remote tracking: local `main` tracks `origin/main`.

### Next Notes
- Replace MVP local JSON persistence with a production database before real member usage.
- Replace seeded email-only auth with secure authentication.
- Continue migrating original webform logic section by section, including calculations and richer PDF formatting.
- Add tests for report creation, protected routes, form saving, PDF export, and role-specific admin/member access.
